]View does it's own thing and we use getters and setters
Main only runs the initial frame ActionListener starts the model

The model:

Create array with k people
populate array with k "true" values

the algorithm... if you are seeing this its likely it didn't work. With this project in particular I kept myself from looking up a solution online.
I have seen this problem solved mathematically before and could have done a simple solution with mod 2 and loops but I wanted to solve it specifically using arrays by setting dead people to "false".
This is what I came up with.

While number of people left > 1{

    look through entire array{

    if false ignore

    if true count down a counter of people left until someone dies

    when counter until death finishes{

        kill current person
        }
    }
}

after only 1 person remains return the index the searcher stopped on. This should be the safe seat.
Push that value to the controller. The controller would then write the safe seat on the output panel.
